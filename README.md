# Introduction

This training framework is made for A WZ->lvll VBS resonance selection using neural networks/BDT.

## How to download & initial setup
```
git clone https://github.com/mociduki/VBF-WZ-lvll.git VBF-WZ-lvll_test
cd VBF-WZ-lvll_test/Inputs/
ln -s /lcg/storage16/atlas/mociduki/lvll_samples/newGMsignal_20200706
ln -s newGMsignal_20200706 MVA
cd ..
. setup.sh
```

## How to setup each time
At every time you login and come down into this working directory, you need to setup the necessary environment as following:
```
. setup.sh
```

### Configuration of trainings
Training configuration is stored inside this python script: config_OPT_NN.py <br>
It contains all relevant settings like:
* hyper-parameters
* list of input variables
* list of samples used for backgrounds and signals
The NN models are implemented using the Keras package.
The training dataset used is a set of simple ntuples, containing all the necessary variables like Mjj, Detajj etc.

### Samples
* Backgrounds: Your background is a combination of the SM WZ QCD and WZ EW processes.
* Signals: You can choose either of the following as your signal:
  * the combined GM H5 samples with masses ranging from 200 to 900 GeV
  * the HVT signal samples ranging from 250 to 1000 GeV

### General configuration of the network
This is a simple fully connected NN, the principal hyper parameters are:
* the number of layers
* number of neurons per layer
* the learning rate
* momentum.

The input is split into a training and validation set (70%/30%).
After each epoch the accuracy is measured on the validation set and only the best performance is saved.
Each signal mass is assigned a label corresponding to the resonance mass.
The background events have a randomnly assigned label, taken of the same probability distribution as the signals.
This should allow an optimal performance for all resonance masses. All Hyperparameters can be specified (see help).

# Run training & application
## Run NN training
An example of commandline to run the training looks like below.
```
python3 OPT_VBS_NN.py --mass_points 200 --model GM --booldropout=1 --dropout=0.20 --lr=0.013 --patience=18 --numn=10 --numlayer=3 --epochs=100 --Findex 0 --nFold 4
```

where booldropout, dropout, lr, patience, numn, numlayer, and epochs are the hyper-parameters in NN.
Note that all the relevant parameters other than designated in the commandline are configured via the aforementioned configuration scpript above.

### nfold cross validation
The last two arguments in the example above, Findex and nFold correspond to the index and the number of folds for the n-fold cross-validation technique.
The Findex runs from 0 to nFold-1, so in this example from 0 to 3.

# Applying the NN to all the ntuples
An example of commandline to run the application looks like below.
```
python3 Apply_NN.py --input sigvalid_GM_S1.798_CVp0.048660_F0o4_NN.h5,sigvalid_GM_S1.778_CVp0.047461_F1o4_NN.h5,sigvalid_GM_S1.794_CVp0.049493_F2o4_NN.h5,sigvalid_GM_S1.788_CVp0.049410_F3o4_NN.h5
```

This applies the trained NN selection to the entire dataset.
It takes the inputs of the models (h5 files), produced by the training in each fold of the cross-validtion, 
therefore you need to check names of the model files created in the each fold. 
The NN prediction is applied on samples in the input directory (Inputs/MVA).
The new samples with NN output are created under a directory called OutputRoot.
The new samples have the identical set of variables as before, but have this additional variable: pSignal, which is a predicted probability to be a signal.
These ntuples/samples can then be used to select the optimal cut on the NN output.

## Running the training
The example below trains a model for a single mass point at 200 GeV and saves the control plots in a subdirectory ControlPlots/m200
```
python3 OPT_VBS_NN.py --mass_points 200 --model GM --dropout=0.20 --lr=0.013 --patience=18 --numn=10 --numlayer=3 --epochs=100 --Findex 0 --nFold 4 --sdir m200
```

This next example trains 4 folds for mass points 200 and 300 individually, saving each plots and models seperately
```
for mass in 200 300
do
    for n in 0 1 2 3
    do
        sdir="m"$mass"-"$n
        python3 OPT_VBS_NN.py --mass_points $mass --model GM --booldropout=1 --dropout=0.20 --lr=0.013 --patience=18 --numn=10 --numlayer=3 --epochs=100 --Findex $n --nFold 4 --sdir 0630/$sdir
    done
done
```

## Applying the model
The example below applies the model and creates new .root ntuples for one fold trained at 200 GeV, saving the results in a subdirectory of OutputRoot 
```
python3 Apply_NN.py --input sigvalid_GM_m[200]_S13.738_CVp0.312000_F0o4_NN.h5 --sdir 0630/m200
```

To apply 4 folds, simply add the file names to the input.

This next example applies each model and folds, and creates new ntuples for masses 200 and 300 individually, assuming 4 folds have been trained already. 
```
for mass in 200 300
do
    input=""
    for path in OutputModel/sigvalid_GM_m[$mass*
    do
        model=${path##*/}
        input+=$model","
    done
    python3 Apply_NN.py --input ${input%?} --sdir 0630/m$mass
done
```

## Plotting some results
Using the example below, figures are created showing the result of the training for the signal, and the EW and QCD background, as well as the integrals of these curves depending on the cut value. One must first edit the location of the files within the code itself and check that the main for-loop runs over existing mass files. 
```
root -l pSignal_cv_plotting.C
```

# Run BDT training and application (obsolete, left only for reference)
* OPT_VBS_BDT.py:

The BDTs are implemented with sklearn.
The Hyper parameters are: base_estimator forming the bossted ensemble, the learning rate and the boosting algorithm.

* Apply_BDT.py:

Similar to Apply_NN this program applies the BDT selection to a given dataset.
The output variable is added to the original ntuple and stored in a new root file.
